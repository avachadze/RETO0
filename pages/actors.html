			<h4>Number One / Spaceboy (Luther Hargreeves)</h4>
			A wealthy entrepreneur and world-renowned scientist. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize for his work in the cerebral advancement of the chimpanzee and is the founder of the Umbrella Academy, a group of adopted super-powered children. Sir Reginald is extremely cold-hearted, often mistreating and even experimenting on the children for his personal interests. He refuses to let the children call him father, demanding that they address him by his codename The Monocle instead. When speaking to the children, he refers to them by number, which was assigned to the children in terms of "usefulness", and has nothing to do with their actual destructive capabilities. Found out in season 2 when Reginald takes off his mask (face) he is some kind of alien creature.

			<h4 id="num2">Number Two / The Kraken (Diego Hargreeves)</h4>
			The reckless and rebellious member of the group; described by Reginald Hargreeves. He has also demonstrated a strong talent for knife-throwing (because he can change the direction of projectiles in midair) and close-quarter combat. He and Luther have a very clear rivalry, and Diego is often unwilling to take orders from Luther. In his teenage years, he was the bassist in the punk rock band the Prime-8s alongside drummer Body (Inspector Lupo's assistant), and guitarist and lead vocalist Vanya Hargreeves / Number Seven (his adopted sister). He is depicted as left-handed in the short story "Anywhere But Here," as he is playing the bass left-handed. In the Netflix adaptation, he harbors a secret love for his ex-girlfriend Detective Eudora Patch
			<h4 id="num3">Number Three / The Rumor (Allison Hargreeves)</h4>
			Described as narcissistic, she has the ability to manipulate reality by lying, using the phrase "I heard a rumour..." to activate the power. She is romantically linked to her adopted brother, Luther Hargreeves. Their love for each other is unconsummated as Spaceboy sees himself as a monstrosity due to his gorilla body. She has a cybernetic left hand as Dr. Terminal devoured her original hand when she was a child. In "Dallas", when she goes to get vocal surgery, her arm is no longer drawn as if it were mechanical, suggesting that it too had been fixed.
			<h4 id="num4">Number Four / The Séance (Klaus Hargreeves)</h4>

			The Séance's powers are speaking with the dead, channeling the dead so they’re speaking through him, possessing people, broadcasting his consciousness through airwaves (allowing him to communicate through TVs), and telekinesis. he also has the power of evocation; making spirits corporeal and capable of being seen by others and interacting with objects around them. It has been theorized by Mr Pogo that he's been doing drugs since he was a teenager. 
			<h4 id="num5">Number Five / The Boy (Five Hargreeves)</h4>
			Number Five had a name but it wasn't spoken for so long that all of his siblings forgot what it was, as did he. At the age of 10 (or 13 in the Netflix adaptation), Five disappeared by using his power of time travel to escape into the future. Sir Reginald always warned him that he "could never go back"; it took him 45 years to figure out how to go back in time. He aged normally during his time in the apocalypse, but upon returning to the past he regained the appearance he had the day he traveled forwards. His body is stuck in time and cannot age, as medical examinations prove that there are no signs of cell growth or death. In the Netflix adaptation, his body continues to age normally after reverting to its 13-year-old form, and Five bemoans "going through puberty twice." 

			<h4 id="num6">Number Six / The Horror (Ben Hargreeves)</h4>
			Number Six possesses monsters from other dimensions under his skin (most often appearing as tentacles emerging from his torso). He is deceased from the results of a mission gone wrong. There is a memorial statue of him located in front of the Academy. Even though he's been dead since before the start of the series, he's been portrayed as a member of The Umbrella Academy, appearing as his statue counterpart, in visions, or with Klaus since he has the ability to talk to the deceased. Since octopus eat themselves under stress, there’s a theory that Ben could’ve died that way, or by suicide. He can connect with Klaus physically, lending him his ability for a moment. 
			<h4 id="num7">Number Seven / The White Violin (Vanya Hargreeves)</h4>
			 Vanya originally showcases no particular powers other than an interest in music. Vanya is known to have written a book detailing her life with the Academy and her decision to leave. After unlocking her powers, she proceeds to murder the Conductor, and travelled to Hargreeves' mansion to destroy it, killing Pogo in the process. During her fight with her siblings, while distracted by Klaus pretending to channel Hargreeves, she’s shot in the back of the head by Number 5 with Hargreeves' revolver. However in the Netflix show Number 3 shoots to the side of her head missing on purpose which makes Vanya lose focus on the sound of her violin and she then passes out. Doctors noted she would eventually recover from her injuries, but would never play the violin again.
